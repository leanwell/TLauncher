####   NOTE:
- This bash script was created at 23rd day of September 2021.
- This script is for personal use only. DO NOT DISTRIBUTE!
- If there's any issues, feel free to submit it in our github repository.
####   USAGE:
There is no application that directly launch TLauncher from your Linux machine.
\
The default command to launch Tlauncher is

`sudo java -jar TLauncher.jar` as you can see the command is pretty long so I created a very simple and harmless script to run TLauncher on your machine.
####   Command:
```
cd Downloads
sudo java -jar TLauncher-2.82.jar
```
####   Installation:
Download or clone the file from my repository.
Download the latest launcher from
[TLauncher](https://tlauncher.org/en/)
- Extract the file if downloaded, skip if you used the clone method.
- Extract the TLauncher-x.jar from TLauncher.zip to your downloads folder (x = version)
- Copy the "mc.sh" file and paste it to your "/home/" folder.
- Open the `mc.sh` file using any text editor and rename the tlauncher version to the one you have, save afterwards.
```
cd Downloads
sudo java -jar TLauncher-2.82.jar # rename the "2.82" to the version you've downloaded
```
- Open terminal and run this command:
\
`chmod +x mc.sh` 

- Test if it's working
\
`./mc.sh`

> Use `./mc.sh` to launch TLauncher directly from your terminal.
\
> No need to use the `cd` command because it is already in the code.
